# Part 5 - Unsupervised Learning Writeup

After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.
High Income, High Spending: Luxury Consumers
High Income, Low Spending: Conscious Spenders
Low Income, High Spending: Impulsive Buyers
Low Income, Low Spending: Thrifty Shoppers
Medium Income, Medium Spending: Balanced Consumers

2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?
If a customer doesn't fall into the Average Shopper category, they are likely to belong to either the Frugal Shopper or Mindful Shopper category.
3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?
Customers in the High-Life cluster may respond more to marketing that highlights quality or luxury products. Individuals who earn and spend significantly more than others in the sample may be more inclined to invest in products that stand out for their superior quality. Therefore, those in the top-right of the graph would be most effectively targeted with marketing that emphasizes the durability and craftsmanship of a product.
