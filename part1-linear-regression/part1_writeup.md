# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?
The r sqaured value is 0.63. This means that its close to being a perfect line. 
2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?
The predicted blood pressure ofr someone who is 42 years old is about equal to 137.5.
3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
I think this model is not enough to reliably predict someones blood pressure based on their age because i feel like there must be more data for a greater accuracy. The model can improve with more specific data.
