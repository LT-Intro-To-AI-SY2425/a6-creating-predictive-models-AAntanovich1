# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?

The r-squared value is 0.86. The model predicts about 86% of the data correctly.

2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?

It was the most accurate because it had the highest r squared coefficient and value.

3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?

A 10-year-old car was predicted with 89000 miles to be $10,601.26. The price for a 20-year-old car with 150,000 miles was $2,802.54.

4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening?

I think that this could be happening because most of the data was with lower mileages and lower ages therefor it is not able to know  a variety of different ages and mileages.
