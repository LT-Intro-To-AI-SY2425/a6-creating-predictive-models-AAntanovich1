# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
This model is more effective than the model I created in the previous lesson becase it uses train-test splitting which helps us to evaluate data that is wasnt seen. 

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
The R squared coefficient tells us how much of the change in blood pressure can be explained by a persons age.

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
I would say that my model is inaccurate because according to my model at age 65 the blood pressure is suppoesd to be under 130 but it seems that it keep going up afterwards above 160. Therefor my model is slightly innacurate.
